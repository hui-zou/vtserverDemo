# vtserverDemo

Short description:

Test data from https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints

I choose California which has Number of Buildings 10,988,525 and the file size is 2.47 GB.

For vector data with ten million numbers of points, lines or polygons, it is difficult to show in browser smoothly.

Vtserver can publish these data into vector tiles on fly for clients such as browser, and No pre-tiling is required. 

Vtserver can be deployed on tomcat.
